# Practice Macro

I don't have a better name for this, it just finds 1.16 seeds to run.

## How to use

In findseed.py, change the threshold variable to whatever you want.<br>
Run macro.ahk and press the hotkey, m by default, to find a seed and create a new world. 
Make sure to be on the main menu of minecraft for the world creation to work properly.
<br>If you aren't on windows or don't have autohotkey, you can just run the python script and copy the seed from seed.txt
